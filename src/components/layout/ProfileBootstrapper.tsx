/**
 * ProfileBootstrapper
 *
 * A lightweight, render-nothing component that fires `useGetProfileQuery`
 * as soon as the authenticated admin shell mounts.
 *
 * Why a separate component?
 * - Keeps the layout clean — no query logic leaks into structural components.
 * - RTK Query's `onQueryStarted` in `authApi.getProfile` already dispatches
 *   `updateUser`, so the Redux store (and therefore Topbar) will reflect the
 *   latest profile_image, full_name, etc. immediately after the API responds —
 *   even on first login, before the user ever visits the Settings page.
 * - RTK Query deduplicates the request: if ProfileSettingsCard (Settings page)
 *   also calls useGetProfileQuery, no second network request is made.
